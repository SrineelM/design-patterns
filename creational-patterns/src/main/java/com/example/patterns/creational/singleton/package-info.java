/**
 * Singleton Pattern Implementation Package
 * 
 * The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides
 * a global point of access to it.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Private constructor prevents external instantiation
 * - Single static instance
 * - Static accessor method (getInstance())
 * 
 * Best Practice: Using enum for thread-safe singleton in Java
 * - Guarantees single instance
 * - Thread-safe by default
 * - Serialization-safe
 * - Reflection-proof
