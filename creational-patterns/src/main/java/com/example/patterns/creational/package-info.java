/**
 * Creational Design Patterns Package
 * 
 * This package contains implementations of all five Creational design patterns
 * from the Gang of Four. These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms,
 * trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
 * 
 * Patterns included:
 * - Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance
 * - Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
 * - Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects
 * - Builder: Constructs complex objects step by step
 * - Prototype: Creates objects by copying an existing prototype
 *
