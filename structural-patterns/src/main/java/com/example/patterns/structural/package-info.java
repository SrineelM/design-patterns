/**
 * Structural Design Patterns Package
 * 
 * This package contains implementations of all seven Structural design patterns
 * from the Gang of Four. These patterns deal with object composition, creating
 * relationships between entities to form larger structures.
 * 
 * Patterns included:
 * - Adapter: Make incompatible interfaces work together
 * - Bridge: Decouple abstraction from implementation
 * - Composite: Treat individual and composite objects uniformly
 * - Decorator: Add behavior to objects dynamically
 * - Facade: Provide simplified interface to complex subsystem
 * - Flyweight: Share fine-grained objects efficiently
 * - Proxy: Provide surrogate for another object
 * 
 * @author Design Patterns Team
 * @version 1.0.0
